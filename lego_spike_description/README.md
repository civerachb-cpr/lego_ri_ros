Lego Spike Description
=======================

This package contains description files for the Lego Spike and Mindstorms
Robot Inventor sets.  Not all Lego parts have descriptions, but sensors
and motors do.

Motors are configured to use continuous joints that rotate around the Z axis.

Distance and Color sensors have their sensing apparatus pointed along the positive X axis.
